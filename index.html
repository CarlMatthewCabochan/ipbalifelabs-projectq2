                <h4> For your first time, you do the first stage of Super Hexagon with a difficulty: "HARD."
                    Upon start, this introduces a rotating Hexagon, with your character being the tiny triangle/arrow.
                    If it's your first time, you get a short tutorial of how to move... Left and Right. </h4>

                <h4> In this game, you have 60 seconds to sucessfully pass each stage.
                     This first stage has its own mechanic. Every 15-25 seconds, it changes into a different shape. </h4>
                    
                    <h4> This goes from: Hexagon, Pentagon and Square. </h4>

                <h4> Although, it doesn't have an order, during the "Pentagon" form, there's a half chance it can change back to Hexagon instead of Square. </h4>
                    <h4> This doesn't apply to Hexagon or Square since it guarantees will just form to a Pentagon. </h4>

                <h4> After 60 seconds of turning and rotating, you pass the first stage, but, it doesn't end there. </h4>
                <h4> This has a Bonus Stage, which is met after getting through the stage above 60 seconds. </h4>
                <h4> Heads up that this Bonus Stage or being referred as "Hyper Stage" is 2 to 3x harder than the normal stage.</h4>
                <h4> The speed dramatically increases and new obstacles will be thrown at you. </h4>
                <h4> There is also a another bonus stage called "Hyper Bonus Stage." This is when you survived another 60 seconds on the "Hyper Stage." </h4>

                <h2> Second Stage + Fifth/Hyper Mode </h2>
                <h4> After passing the First Stage of Super Hexagon, this time it doesn't have its own mechanics. Meaning no shapeshifts of being Pentagon or Square. </h4>
                <h4> This stage instead focuses on reaction time and precision, its obstacles are much shallower and has less room for error. </h4>
                <h4> And again, after surviving for more than 60 seconds, you get to the Normal Bonus Stage, but this causes the whole map to invert color. </h4>
                <h4> Of course, the speed dramatically increases once getting into that stage, and it also has its own "Hyper Bonus Stage" aswell. </h4>

                <h4> This stage has an invert color of Background White and the obstacles including you flashing reddish to pinkish. </h4>
                <h4> After another 60 seconds of surviving, you get into the "Hyper Bonus Stage" which switches the invertion of the stage. </h4>
                <h4> The obstacles becomes the background color, while the background becomes the obstacles' color. </h4>

                <h2> Third Stage + Hyper Mode/Final Stage </h2>
                <h4> This is the Final Stage of the game named "Hexagonest." </h4>
                <h4> This is the same stage and mechanic of the Second Stage, but this time, its rotation is trickier. </h4>
                <h4> This rotation sometimes fools you, continously rotating and then all of a sudden stops and goes the other way in a swift second.</h4>
                <h4> You will need A LOT of practice to get past this stage. </h4>
